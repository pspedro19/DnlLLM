# Microservices Architecture for Language Model Project

## Overview
This project utilizes a microservices architecture to implement and manage a language model. The architecture is designed to facilitate inter-service communication, track machine learning experiments, manage model lifecycles, store artifacts, and monitor tasks. Below is a detailed explanation of each component and how they interact.

## Architecture Components

### 1. **Chat**
- **Purpose**: Manages the user interface and processes user requests.
- **Connection**: Sends user requests to the REST API for processing.

### 2. **REST API (FastAPI)**
- **Purpose**: Provides inter-service communication between the components of the architecture.
- **Connection**: Receives requests from the Chat service and forwards them to MLflow for model interactions and artifact handling.

### 3. **MLflow**
- **Purpose**: Tracks machine learning experiments and manages the model lifecycle.
- **Connection**:
  - Receives data from REST API.
  - Interacts with Apache Airflow to orchestrate workflows.
  - Stores and retrieves artifacts from MinIO.
  - Utilizes PostgreSQL for metadata storage.

### 4. **Apache Airflow**
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates workflows and schedules tasks.
- **Connection**:
  - Schedules tasks through a dedicated Scheduler.
  - Provides monitoring through a Webserver.
  - Sends and receives performance metrics to and from Wandb.

### 5. **Scheduler & Webserver**
- **Purpose**: These components are part of Apache Airflow.
  - **Scheduler**: Manages the timing of workflows.
  - **Webserver**: Provides a GUI for monitoring the scheduled tasks.

### 6. **Wandb**
- **Purpose**: Tracks the visualization and performance of models.
- **Connection**: Receives data from Apache Airflow to visualize task performance.

### 7. **MinIO**
- **Purpose**: S3-compatible storage used for managing ML artifacts.
- **Connection**:
  - Stores artifacts generated or used by MLflow.

### 8. **PostgreSQL**
- **Purpose**: Database used for storing metadata and operational data.
- **Connection**:
  - Stores experiment and model data for MLflow.
  - Maintains operational data for Apache Airflow.

## Diagram Visualization
The microservices architecture diagram visually represents the interconnections between different services. Each service is depicted with its respective icon and connected through lines indicating data flow and interactions.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Security**: Implement security measures like API gateways or OAuth to manage access to the services.
- **Scalability**: Consider container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes for better scalability and management of services.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate comprehensive monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for better insight into service performance and health.
- **Bidirectional Data Flow**: Review and ensure that bidirectional data flows are necessary and optimized for performance.
